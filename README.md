# Whole genome sequencing and plasma metabolomics unveil genetic determinants and clinical implications for human health
## Description
This repository contains Linux/R code for the analysis implemented in the genetic atlas of the human plasma metabolome, as described in the paper 'Whole genome sequencing and plasma metabolomics unveil genetic determinants and clinical implications for human health'.

Metabolome-genomic results and summary statistics generated in this study are publicly available through our interactive portal (https://metabolome-whole-genome-landscape.com/).
